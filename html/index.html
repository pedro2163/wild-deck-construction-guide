    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p> I propose some possible replacement cards based on this meta and why those cards can be useful.
        <br>
        In red: don’t craft those cards, only add them if you have them in your collection.
        <br>
        In orange: I would say don’t craft those cards, but if you really need them go for it.
        <br>
        In green: must-to-have cards, I still propose a replacement but those cards really make a difference.
        <br>
        When you see Choose one in the *** version it’s because you have the choice to choose one of the cards listed
        there
        in the deck version mentioned. For the decklist I was obligated to choose one for you, but you can change it
        following that section!
        <br>
        At the right of the Budget deck you will see some numbers at the same level of the cards to change. That number
        is
        the priority order, so #1 is the first change to make (and the first card to remove). If you have in your
        collection, for example, the #3 card to replace you need to add it! Don’t wait to have the #1 and #2 to add it
        after. If this happens, don’t remove #1 and add #3, you still need to remove #3 and add #3!
        <br>
        Normally if you can build the Semi Budget version you have a very strong deck, the final version it’s just a
        bonus.
        <br>
        The Budget decks don’t have Epics and Legendaries unless they are Really a need in the deck.
        <br>
        If you want to know which cards you can dust, just see <a
                href="https://www.hearthpwn.com/members/Pedro21631330/collection">this collection</a>. I recommend you
        to keep
        every card in that collection.
        <br>
        Enjoy :)</p>

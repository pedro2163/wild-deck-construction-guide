# Reno Priest Guide

## Deck description

## How to build the deck?
### Start by including all the core cards.
This deck has 22 core cards.
![Core cards](core.png)

|For the 22th card you need to make a choice:|
|:---:|
|Forbidden Words|
|Shadow Word: Pain|

### Choose your package
After, choose a package. There are two packages right now: the normal and the dragon. Togwaggle and Gadgetzan  packages are okay but aren't the bests. Velen and Quest packages are not good in this meta.
|Normal|Dragon|
|:--:|:---:|
|Raise Dead|Cleric of Scales|
|Holy Smite|Draconic Studies|
|Renew|Duskbreaker|
|Loot Hoarder|Big Ol'Whelp|
|Seance|Drakonid Operative|
|Gluttonous Ooze|Dragonfire Potion|

### Then, make some choices
|You can add the other one, or not|
|:---:|
|Forbidden Words|
|Shadow Word: Pain|

|Do you see few aggro decks?|
|:---:|
|Add Loatheb|

|Choose the last card in the normal version|why?|
|:---|---:|
|Sphere of Sapience||
|Mo'arg Artificier|Great with Holy Smite, Spirit Lash and Holy Nova, great vs Aggro|
|Holy Nova|Great vs Aggro|
|Shadow Word: Ruin|Great vs Warlock|

|Choose the last card in the dragon version|why?|
|:--:|:--:|
|Raise Dead||
|Holy Nova|Great vs Aggro|
|Sphere of Sapience||
|Twilight Whelp|Hold a Dragon. Great vs Aggro|

### Flexible cards
|Normal|Dragon|
|:--:|:---:|
|Renew|Forbidden Words or Shadow Word: Pain|
|Breath of the Infinite|           Draconic Studies           |
|Gluttonous Ooze|          Twilight Guardian           |
||Mass Hysteria or Dragonfire Potion|

### Possible cards
|Normal|Dragon|
|:--:|:---:|
|Golakka Crawler|Renew|
|   Acolyte of Pain   |Manafeeder Panthara|
|Kobold Stickyfinger| Acidic Swamp Ooze or Gluttonous Ooze |
|Zilliax|           Acolyte of Pain            |
|Emperor Thaurissan|             Platebreaker             |
|Jepetto Joybuzz|               Zilliax                |

### Other cards
The past versions of the normal deck had Dragonfire Potion or Soul Mirror. Now, because of Lorekeeper Poleklt, the deck has become really more aggressive: we don't have one turn to lose after we play him. We need to have Raza the Chained and Spawn of Shadows as soon as possible.

You can consider Brann Bronzebeard. If you do, you can consider Coldlight Oracle, Zola the Gorgon and/or Cobalt Spellkin too,

You can consider Witchwood Piper: you need to remove every 1-mana and 2-mana minions but Zephrys the Great. It is not recommended if you see lot of aggro decks

## Building the deck: Budget to Final
I recommend you to build the Dragon Budget version because dragons are cheap and strong.
If you don't have Cleric of Scales you can replace it with Manafeeder Panthara.

### Budget
![Budget](dragonbudget.png)
AAEBAa0GHvsBlwKcAskGigfTCtYK1wryDPsM7hH3E4O7ArW7Arq7AvDPApDTAsvmAuj5ApeHA+aIA5ibA5mpA/KsA+ewA4exA5i2A5O6A93MA97MAwAA

### Semi Budget
Raise Dead is not necessary here, you can keep Renew.

### Priority order
Zephrys the Great, Reno Jackson and Kazakus are the first cards to have: that's why we play highlander! You can craft Psychic Scream before Kazakus if you see lots of Mirror matchups.
Psychic Scream and Shadow Visions are the most important spells in the deck.
Lorekeeper Polkelt is a new core card because it gives us our combo faster.
Mindrender Illucia is the next card to craft because it's our Win Condition versus combo decks. If you have 400 dust, you can craft Dirty Rat before.
Dirty Rat, Loatheb and Gluttonous Ooze are the last cards to craft, they are really specific tech cards.

## Mulligan
### Demon Hunter
![Mulligan](mulligandemonhunter.png) ![Mulligan](mulligandemonhunterthecoin.png)

### Druid
Mindrender Illucia is the card you need here. Try to mulligan for Draw if you don't have her. Don't keep three control cards, keep one, or two if you have The Coin.
![Mulligan](mulligandruid.png) ![Mulligan](mulligandruidthecoin.png)

### Hunter
![Mulligan](mulliganhunter.png) ![Mulligan](mulliganhunterthecoin.png)

### Mage
If you have Breath of the Infinite and Bloodmage Thalnos keep them both, if you don't have them, don't keep any.
![Mulligan](mulliganmage.png) ![Mulligan](mulliganmagethecoin.png)

### Paladin
Only keep Mass Dispell if you have the other cards in hand. Don't keep it if you have Zephrys the Great.

### Matchups
### Demon Hunter
It will be Aggro. Don't play Lorekeeper Polkelt too early. If you play him on turn 4 you will not play any new cards those turns! Be careful versus aggro decks! You can always Mindrender Illucia early in the game to avoid him playing his next turn, or to burn his The Coin or small cards.

### Druid
If it is Aggro just play normally. He will went out of ressources. Don't be scared of playing Dirty Rat (but be careful after Embiggen). You can always Mindrender Illucia early in the game to avoid him playing his next turn, or to burn his The Coin or small cards. DON'T use Lorekeeper Polkelt, just control him.

If it is Jade it is easy. Just be careful of Naturalize! Don't be afraid of the armour if you are not playing with Dragons. Just use Seance on Spawn of Shadows and kill him over three turns (first turn Spawn of Shadows and Seance, second turn Reno Jackson, third turn Spawn of Shadows again).

If it is Malygos, Togwaggle or Linecracker, you just need to Dirty Rat or Mindrender Illucia in the good moment. That moment is after he plays Juicy Psychmelon, Emperor Thaurissan, or when you think he will combo next turn. The deck is easy to beat, you just need to have those two cards. So, DON'T use Lorekeeper Polkelt, it is hard to win by using your combo, **normally** Druids are faster.

### Hunter
Even and Odd. It will be Aggro. Don't play Lorekeeper Polkelt too early. If you play him on turn 4 you will not play any new cards those turns! Be careful versus aggro decks! You can always Mindrender Illucia early in the game to avoid him playing his next turn, or to burn his The Coin or small cards.

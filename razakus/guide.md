### Choose your package
There are two packages right now: the normal and the dragon. Togwaggle and Gadgetzan  packages are okay but aren't the bests. Velen and Quest packages are not good in this meta.
|Normal|Dragon|
|:--:|:---:|
|Raise Dead|Cleric of Scales|
|Holy Smite|Drakonid Studies|
|Renew|Duskbreaker|
|Loot Hoarder|Big Ol'Whelp|
|Seance|Drakonid Operative|
|Gluttonous Ooze|Dragonfire Potion|

### Make some choices
|Choose at least one|
|:---:|
|Forbidden Words|
|Shadow Word: Pain|

|Do you see few aggro decks?|
|:---:|
|Add Loatheb|

|Choose the last card|why?|

### Possible cards
The past versions of the normal deck had Dragonfire Potion or Soul Mirror. Now, because of Lorekeeper Poleklt, the deck has become really more aggressive: we don't have one turn to lose after we play him. We need to have Raza the Chained and Spawn of Shadows as soon as possible.

You can consider Brann Bronzebeard. If you do, you can consider Coldlight Oracle, Zola the Gorgon and/or Cobalt Spellkin too,

You can consider Witchwood Piper: you need to remove every 1-mana and 2-mana minions but the Great. It is not recommended if you see lot of aggro decks

You can build the Gadgetzan Auctionner + Wild Pyromancer version by adding lots of little cost spells like Circle of Healing, Regenerate, Silence, Whispers of Evil, Binding Heal and Potion of Madness.

### Flexible cards
IMO Dirty Rat, Breath of the Infinite and Mass Dispell are flexible.

## Budget to Final
I recommend you to build the Dragon Budget version because dragons are cheap and strong.
If you don't have Cleric of Scales you can replace it with Manafeeder Panthara.

### Semi Budget
Raise Dead is not necessary here, you can keep Renew.

### Priority order
Zephrys the Great, Reno Jackson and Kazakus are the first cards to have: that's why we play highlander! You can craft Psychic Scream before Kazakus if you see lots of Mirror matchups.

Psychic Scream and Shadow Visions are the most important spells in the deck.

Lorekeeper Polkelt is a new core card because it gives us our combo faster.

Mindrender Illucia is the next card to craft because it's our Win Condition versus combo decks. If you have 400 dust, you can craft Dirty Rat before.

Dirty Rat, Loatheb and Gluttonous Ooze are the last cards to craft, they are really specific tech cards.

## Mulligan

### Matchups
Don't play Lorekeeper Polkelt too early. If you play him on turn 4 you will not play any new cards those turns! Be careful versus aggro decks!

## Combos
If you played versus another Razakus, you play Mindrender Illucia and you see a Pyschic Scream, don't forget that you will send the minions to your deck!

### How does it work?

I propose some possible replacement cards based on this meta and why those cards can be useful.

In red: don’t craft those cards, only add them if you have them in your collection.

In orange: I would say don’t craft those cards, but if you really need them go for it.

In green: must-to-have cards, I still propose a replacement but those cards really make a difference.

When you see *Choose* *one* *in* *the* *** *version* it’s because you have the choice to choose one of the cards listed there in the deck version mentioned. For the decklist I was obligated to choose one for you, but you can change it following that section! 

At the right of the Budget deck you will see some numbers at the same level of the cards to change. That number is the priority order, so #1 is the first change to make (and the first card to remove). If you have in your collection, for example, the #3 card to replace you need to add it! Don’t wait to have the #1 and #2 to add it after. If this happens, don’t remove #1 and add #3, you still need to remove #3 and add #3!

Normally if you can build the Semi Budget version you have a very strong deck, the final version it’s just a bonus.

The Budget decks don’t have Epics and Legendaries unless they are Really a need in the deck.

[If you want to know which cards you can dust, just see this collection. I recommend you to keep every card in that collection.](https://www.hearthpwn.com/members/Pedro21631330/collection)

Enjoy :)
